# Rust Crawler: Port Scanning and Subdomain Enumeration

A simple and efficient crawler built with **Rust** for network reconnaissance. This tool enables port scanning and subdomain enumeration, leveraging Rust's high performance and concurrency features to provide fast and reliable results.

## Features

- **Port Scanning**:
  - Scans a target for open ports within a given range.
  - Supports scanning common ports or user-defined ranges.
- **Subdomain Enumeration**:
  - Discovers subdomains of a given domain using DNS queries.
  - Supports integration with wordlists for comprehensive subdomain enumeration.
- **Concurrency**:
  - Uses Rust's asynchronous capabilities for simultaneous scanning and enumeration.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Ensure Rust is installed on your system. ([Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
- **Wordlist** (Optional): For extensive subdomain enumeration, provide a wordlist file.
